# Football Spotlight - a football app
I built a full stack application which is about football. The application is called Football Spotlight. It provides a holistic view of the football ecosystem, capturing the relationships between different entities such as managers, users, players, football clubs, and contracts. The database is designed in such a way that can be used for various analyses, such as player performance, contract management and club performance. 

### Apache Camel integration:
__Also I enhanced the integration in the backend via Apache Camelâ€™s EIPs.__ 

Example: built a route for  transforming XML to JSON.

I built an Apache Camel route which is configured to handle HTTP GET requests to the endpoint /json/players using the servlet component. Upon receiving a GET request, it routes the request to the direct:xmlToJSON endpoint.Then, the route consumes messages from the seda:xmlToJSON endpoint, retrieves XML player data using the getPlayers method from the ExistService, and processes it using the XML_JSON_Processor class.
The XML_JSON_Processor class implements the Processor interface and is responsible for converting XML data to JSON format. It first checks if the incoming body is an instance of RemoteXMLResource, extracts the XML content, and cleans up the XML content if needed. Then, it uses Jackson's XmlMapper to map the XML content to a Java object, and then converts the Java object to JSON format using Jackson's ObjectMapper. Finally, it sets the JSON output as the body of the exchange.So overall, this route having the XML player data, converts it to JSON format, and sends the JSON to the client.

### __Tech stack:__ 
Backend - Spring, local XML(XML DB), existDB;  Frontend - Angular.
